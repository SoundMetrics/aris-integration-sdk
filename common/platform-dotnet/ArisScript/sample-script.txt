#
# Commands must be entirely on one line.
# Commands are not case sensitive.
# Lines that start with # are comments.
# These are the commands:
#
#   wait 1 - specify how many seconds to wait.
#
#   label name - specify a target for goto.
#
#   focus 2 - tell the sonar to focus at 2 meters.
#
#   goto name - tell the script to jump to a label.
