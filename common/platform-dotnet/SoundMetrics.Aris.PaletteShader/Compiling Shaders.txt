How to Compile the Shader
=========================

The shader file RenderShader.ps is produced by the HLSL compiler. This file need to
be regenerated every time the shader code in RenderShader.fx is modified.

To do so, perform the following steps:

1) Verify that you have the latest DirectX SDK installed. It can be installed from
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx
   
2) Add the DirectX bin directory to the PATH. Usually this path is the following:
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2009)\Utilities\bin\x86"
   
3) Go to the directory where RenderShader.fx is located.

4) Run the shader compiler with the following command line:
   "fxc /T ps_2_0 /E main /FoRenderShader.ps RenderShader.fx"

5) Verify that the compiler didn't output any errors.
