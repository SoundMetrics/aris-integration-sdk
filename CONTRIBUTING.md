# Contributions Guideline

The purpose of this guideline is to save you and Sound Metrics time on the way to improving the ARIS Integration SDK.

### Trivial Bugs

If you've found a truly trivial bug--such as a typo or simple math error--feel free to open a
pull request to fix it. We will review it, make changes, and apply it as appropriate.

Alternatively, open an [issue](https://github.com/SoundMetrics/aris-integration-sdk/issues) to begin a conversation
with us about fixing the bug.

### Substantial Bugs

For  any bug of more than trivial effort please open an
[issue](https://github.com/SoundMetrics/aris-integration-sdk/issues) to begin a conversation
with us about fixing the bug--before making any effort at a pull request.

### Discussing Features

For feature requests please open an [issue](https://github.com/SoundMetrics/aris-integration-sdk/issues) to begin a conversation.
New features, in particular, will be evaluated for soundness and prioritized.

Feel free to weigh in on existing feature discussions in [issues](https://github.com/SoundMetrics/aris-integration-sdk/issues).
